                <p>
                    Flassipa was born in <strong>Stark</strong>, in one of the neglected districts where the lights never truly go out but the warmth of living things has long since faded. Her childhood was fractured — a tangle of silence, neglect, and the mechanical hum of machines that seemed more alive than the people around her.
                    <br/><br/>When she was sixteen, the dreams began. At first, they were just fragments — a sea of stars, voices calling her name, strange landscapes pulsing with color and life. But soon she understood: they weren&#39;t dreams at all. She was crossing the Divide, slipping into <strong>Arcadia</strong>, the world of magic and balance.
                    <br/><br/>There, she learned she was a Dreamer, one of the few who could walk freely between Stark and Arcadia. She glimpsed the truth of the Balance — that the two worlds depended on one another, even as both began to fracture under unseen forces.
                    <br/><br/>But when she tried to use her newfound gift to help mend the Surges — bursts of chaotic energy ripping through Stark&#39;s networks — she failed. Her actions caused a collapse in a small district&#39;s data grid, hurting people she had meant to save. The guilt never left her.
                    <br/><br/>Since that day, Flassipa has wandered between worlds — seeking redemption through creation. In Stark, she works with code and circuits, weaving stability into broken systems. In Arcadia, she shapes light and air into patterns that heal. She believes that beauty — whether made of magic or technology — can restore what&#39;s been lost.
                    <br/><br/>Flassipa doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;ll ever bring balance back, but she&#39;s vowed to keep walking the Longest Journey until she does.
